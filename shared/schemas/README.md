# Shared Schemas & Types

Purpose: Centralize API contracts shared between backend and frontend.

- `api/` — OpenAPI or YAML specifications for REST endpoints.
- `json/` — JSON Schema artifacts for request/response validation.
- `types/` — Frontend TypeScript types (added later) for strong typing.

Contracts will be defined in Step 8.
